#NOTES
#GitHub is a collaborative living repository that is worth learning
#Git is the shortened version and can be accessed in a tab in the same #quadrant where "environment" lives
#.md stands for Markdown in the file name
#R projects is more efficient way of doing coding since setwd() has many paths
#rm(list = ls()) doesn't actually remove everything like packages are still #loaded
